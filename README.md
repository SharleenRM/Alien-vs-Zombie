# Alien vs. Zombie

In this turn-based combat game called Alien vs. Zombie, the player controls an alien who must kill hordes of zombies. The player can alter the game's dimensions beforehand, such as the size of the game board and the number of zombies. Moreover, the player has the option of loading and saving games into files.

## User Manual

The board is initialised with characters and objects before the game begins. Zombies and the other game objects are distributed randomly over the board, whereas Alien always starts in the centre. The programme needs to make sure the characters don't overlap each other.

Throughout the game, Alien and Zombie takes turn to act, with the Alien always taking the first turn. At every turn, the board is displayed, the life and attack of both characters are updated, and messages explaining what happens at each step are showed to keep players informed about the game’s progress.

The game ends when either Alien or Zombie is defeated. The player can choose to play again, and if they do, the game will restart with the board reinitialized and the characters’ life and attack reset to their initial values.
